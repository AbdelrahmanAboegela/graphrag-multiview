# Root Cause Analysis Report

# Equipment: Centrifugal Pump P-101

# Incident Date: 2024-02-15

# Report ID: RCA-2024-015

## Executive Summary

This Root Cause Analysis (RCA) investigates the mechanical seal failure on Centrifugal Pump P-101 that occurred on February 15, 2024, resulting in 8 hours of unplanned downtime and product loss.

## Incident Description

**Equipment:** Centrifugal Pump P-101 (Mechanical Seal Type: John Crane Type 1)
**Failure Mode:** Catastrophic mechanical seal failure with significant product leakage
**Impact:** 8 hours downtime, 500 gallons product loss, environmental incident (Tier 2)
**Personnel:** No injuries reported

## Timeline of Events

**14:30** - Operator noticed slight seal weeping during routine rounds
**14:45** - Vibration alarm triggered (bearing temperature 85°C, normal is 65°C)
**15:00** - Seal failure escalated, significant leakage observed
**15:05** - Emergency shutdown initiated, pump isolated
**15:30** - Spill response team deployed, area secured
**16:00** - Maintenance team began investigation

## Root Cause Analysis - 5 Whys

**Why 1:** Why did the mechanical seal fail?

- Seal faces showed excessive wear and thermal damage

**Why 2:** Why were the seal faces damaged?

- Inadequate cooling water flow to seal flush system

**Why 3:** Why was cooling water flow inadequate?

- Cooling water strainer was 80% plugged with debris

**Why 4:** Why was the strainer plugged?

- Strainer cleaning interval was extended from 30 to 60 days

**Why 5:** Why was the interval extended?

- Maintenance schedule optimization project reduced PM frequency without engineering review

**ROOT CAUSE:** Inadequate Management of Change (MOC) process - PM frequency change was not properly risk-assessed.

## Contributing Factors

1. **Lack of condition monitoring:** No seal flush flow meter installed
2. **Inadequate operator training:** Seal weeping not recognized as critical symptom
3. **Delayed response:** 30-minute gap between first observation and shutdown
4. **Preventive maintenance gap:** Last seal inspection was 90 days prior (should be 60 days)

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate (Completed)

1. ✅ Replaced mechanical seal with new John Crane Type 1
2. ✅ Cleaned and inspected cooling water system
3. ✅ Restored strainer cleaning to 30-day interval
4. ✅ Installed seal flush flow meter with low-flow alarm

### Short-term (30 days)

- [ ] Conduct MOC review training for maintenance planners
- [ ] Update PM schedule to original frequencies
- [ ] Install vibration monitoring on all critical pumps
- [ ] Enhance operator training on seal failure symptoms

### Long-term (90 days)

- [ ] Implement condition-based monitoring for seal health
- [ ] Upgrade to dual mechanical seals on critical services
- [ ] Install automatic shutdown on seal flush low-flow
- [ ] Develop seal failure prediction model

## Lessons Learned

1. **MOC Process:** All PM frequency changes must undergo formal MOC with engineering review
2. **Condition Monitoring:** Early warning systems prevent catastrophic failures
3. **Operator Awareness:** Front-line personnel are first line of defense
4. **Preventive Maintenance:** Optimizing schedules must balance cost vs. risk

## Recommendations for Similar Equipment

Apply learnings to pumps P-102, P-103, P-104:

- Install seal flush flow meters
- Verify cooling water strainer condition
- Review and validate PM frequencies
- Enhance operator training on seal symptoms
