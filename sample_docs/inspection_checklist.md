## Visual Inspection

### Pump Body

- [ ] Check for external leaks (seal, gaskets, flanges)
- [ ] Inspect casing for cracks, corrosion, or damage
- [ ] Verify foundation bolts are tight
- [ ] Check alignment marks (should match baseline)
- [ ] Inspect coupling guard (secure and undamaged)

### Mechanical Seal

- [ ] Observe seal area for leakage (max 3 drops/minute acceptable)
- [ ] Check seal flush system (flow rate 2-5 GPM)
- [ ] Verify cooling water temperature (< 50°C)
- [ ] Inspect seal housing for cracks or damage

### Bearings

- [ ] Check bearing housing for oil leaks
- [ ] Verify oil level in sight glass (center of glass)
- [ ] Inspect for unusual noise or vibration
- [ ] Check bearing housing temperature (< 80°C)

### Lubrication System

- [ ] Verify oil level in reservoir
- [ ] Check oil condition (clear, no contamination)
- [ ] Inspect oil cooler (if equipped) for leaks
- [ ] Verify automatic lubrication system operation
