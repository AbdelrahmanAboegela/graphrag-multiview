# Technical Bulletin TB-2024-003

# Subject: Bearing Lubrication Best Practices

# Issued: March 1, 2024

# Applies to: All Centrifugal Pumps

## Purpose

This technical bulletin provides updated guidance on bearing lubrication practices for centrifugal pumps to prevent premature bearing failures and extend equipment life.

## Background

Recent analysis of bearing failures across our pump fleet revealed that 65% of failures were lubrication-related. Common issues include:

- Over-lubrication causing churning and overheating
- Under-lubrication causing metal-to-metal contact
- Wrong lubricant type or grade
- Contaminated lubricant

## Lubrication Requirements

### Oil-Lubricated Bearings

**Oil Type:** ISO VG 32 or VG 46 turbine oil
**Oil Level:** Center of sight glass (±5mm)
**Change Interval:**

- Normal service: 12 months or 8,000 hours
- High temperature (>70°C): 6 months or 4,000 hours
- Contaminated environment: 6 months

**Oil Condition Monitoring:**

- Visual inspection monthly (clarity, color, contamination)
- Oil analysis every 6 months (viscosity, water content, metals)
- Change immediately if water contamination detected

### Grease-Lubricated Bearings

**Grease Type:** NLGI Grade 2, lithium complex base
**Regreasing Interval:**

- 1800 RPM: Every 3 months
- 3600 RPM: Every 1 month
- High temperature: Reduce interval by 50%

**Regreasing Procedure:**

1. Clean grease fitting thoroughly
2. Remove drain plug (if equipped)
3. Add grease slowly while pump is running
4. Stop when fresh grease appears at drain
5. Run pump for 30 minutes to purge excess
6. Replace drain plug

**Grease Quantity:**

- Small bearings (< 50mm): 5-10 grams
- Medium bearings (50-100mm): 15-25 grams
- Large bearings (> 100mm): 30-50 grams

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Over-greasing:** Causes churning, overheating, seal damage
✅ **Correct:** Follow manufacturer's quantity recommendations

❌ **Mixing grease types:** Incompatible greases can separate
✅ **Correct:** Purge old grease completely before changing types

❌ **Ignoring temperature:** Hot bearings need more frequent lubrication
✅ **Correct:** Adjust intervals based on operating temperature

❌ **Contaminated lubricant:** Dirt and water cause rapid wear
✅ **Correct:** Use clean containers, wipe fittings, store properly

## Lubrication Schedule by Equipment

### Pump P-101 (1800 RPM, Oil-Lubricated)

- **Check oil level:** Weekly
- **Oil analysis:** Every 6 months
- **Oil change:** Every 12 months
- **Oil type:** ISO VG 32

### Pump P-102 (1800 RPM, Oil-Lubricated)

- **Check oil level:** Weekly
- **Oil analysis:** Every 6 months
- **Oil change:** Every 12 months
- **Oil type:** ISO VG 32

### Valve V-201 Actuator (Grease-Lubricated)

- **Regrease:** Every 6 months
- **Grease type:** NLGI Grade 2, lithium complex
- **Quantity:** 15 grams per fitting

## Troubleshooting

### High Bearing Temperature (>80°C)

**Possible Causes:**

1. Insufficient lubrication → Check oil level, add if low
2. Over-lubrication → Drain to correct level
3. Wrong lubricant viscosity → Change to correct grade
4. Bearing damage → Inspect and replace if needed

### Bearing Noise

**Possible Causes:**

1. Insufficient lubrication → Add lubricant
2. Contaminated lubricant → Change lubricant
3. Bearing wear → Inspect and replace
4. Misalignment → Check and correct alignment

### Oil Contamination

**Water in Oil:**

- Appears milky or cloudy
- Action: Change oil immediately, find water source

**Metal Particles:**

- Indicates bearing wear
- Action: Schedule bearing replacement, increase monitoring

## Storage and Handling

**Lubricant Storage:**

- Store indoors in clean, dry area
- Keep containers sealed when not in use
- Label containers clearly with lubricant type
- Rotate stock (first-in, first-out)
- Shelf life: 2 years for oil, 1 year for grease

**Handling:**

- Use clean, dedicated containers
- Never mix different lubricant types
- Wipe fittings before greasing
- Use clean grease guns
- Dispose of used oil properly

## Training Requirements

All maintenance technicians must complete:

- Lubrication fundamentals training (4 hours)
- Hands-on lubrication practice (2 hours)
- Annual refresher (1 hour)
